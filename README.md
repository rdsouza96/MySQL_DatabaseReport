# MySQL_DatabaseReport
With the humongous amount of data inundating the internet on an hourly basis, there is a need for advanced technology that can process such data through categorization and organization so that it can be effectively stored in a particular location and is easily retrievable. Databases fulfill such purpose by providing a system to store enormous amounts of data that can easily be searched to access specific records through the use of queries. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate adequate knowledge on data modelling and database design to manage data as information professionals through the skills learnt in this course. The database in this project was built and implemented using MySQL for a City 311 application to service requests in the Dallas area. The database has been built from the base table provided in the City 311 application and has been normalized to create several entities and their attributes for a refined search. Understanding relational databases, normalization, creation of data dictionaries, and data integrity have been the key learning outcomes of this project.
