# MySQL_DatabaseReport

# Introduction
With the humongous amount of data inundating the internet on an hourly basis, there is a need for advanced technology that can process such data through categorization and organization so that it can be effectively stored in a particular location and is easily retrievable. Databases fulfill such purpose by providing a system to store enormous amounts of data that can easily be searched to access specific records through the use of queries. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate adequate knowledge on data modelling and database design to manage data as information professionals through the skills learnt in this course. The database in this project was built and implemented using MySQL for a City 311 application to service requests in the Dallas area. The database has been built from the base table provided in the City 311 application and has been normalized to create several entities and their attributes for a refined search. Understanding relational databases, normalization, creation of data dictionaries, and data integrity have been the key learning outcomes of this project.

# Overview

The 311 Service Requests from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2018 serve as a record of emergency and non-emergency calls made into the service in Dallas, TX. The service has access to over 400 service request types of various natures that affect the quality of life of a neighbourhood, community or a citizen. Some of the typical calls include feedback or requests about animal services, sidewalk obstruction, sanitation services, street and pothole repair as well as other code violations. 

# Scope

The City 311 database covers the portion of the Dallas Open Data System that pertains to the 311 system. The information is limited data found within the dates October 01, 2016 to September 30, 2018. The database covers information on citizen, requests made by the citizens, location of requests, case files maintained for each request that has been made, service, and department information. The database limitations still provide ample information for users to understand what types of requests are being made and how often and well they are handled. Moreover, users can also view which requests are being handled by which department and the different requests that have seen a rise or fall over the years from 2016 to 2018. The case files associated with each request maintains information on how the request was served and whether it was resolved in an adequate response time. 

# Objective

The objectives of this database are to:
 
- Provide information on citizens requesting services, modes of request, location of calls, department jurisdiction, case files, and services provided.
- Guide users and software developers in assessing the information and providing solutions.
- Providing transparency and accountability for the City of Dallas with information about emergency and non-emergency (standard) calls made to the city.  
- Empower Dallas citizens, businesses, and visitors with information about the city. 
- Give citizens access to information on how calls are handled in a timely/responsive manner.
- To improve the services by comparing the number of requests received for a particular service over the span of three years from 2016 to 2018
